The below is the code to print query in your logger file. Put this logic where your query execution/preparation call is present like executeQuery() method calls.
Generally we use jrebel or some tools to sync our changes, if you made changes in query and you want to know your query got synced or not, you can print your query.
This will print the query you have written, but not hibernate generated query.

For example :  query = "from employes" - this you have written
it will print from employes only, but not SQL generated by hibernate.

String s = query.unwrap(org.hibernate.Query.class).getQueryString();
LOGGER.info("###### query : " + s);

Note : by enabling sql = true in your configuartion, sql query will print to your server console but not in your logger file.
