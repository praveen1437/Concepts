To print hibernate logs in to your log file, make sure to add foloowing dependecy to your project
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.logging</groupId>
    <artifactId>jboss-logging</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.2.Final</version>
</dependency>

in your log configuration file

<Logger name="org.hibernate" level="debug">
<Logger name="org.hibernate.SQL" level="debug">
<Logger name="org.hibernate.type" level="trace">

trace -- is used to display the parameters which are being passed to your query and what is the data fecthing from db. 
Without trace you can only know the query but not the parameter values

By enabling these your request processting takes more time. And you will get more logs, 
so make sure to increase your log file size so that your logs won't be replaced with new logs.

Note : Use this when required and not to enable in production
